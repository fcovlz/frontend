                Soft skills
            </h1>
            <h2>
                <p>In this section I'll explain with examples how to gain experience in each area of the soft skills. Each specific area of your interpersonal skills are always in development. They are very useful in your daily work but also in any other social circle you are in. You'll see how you improve your relationship with yourself, so with all the people around you.</p>
                <p>These methods have worked for me, but doesn't mean they will work for you. Don't believe anything written below, I strongly recommend you to read it as something that worked for me and something you can corroborate in your daily life. I'm not a professor, sociologist, guru or expert in the area of the soft skills. I'm just an answer seeker.</p>
                <p class="title_text_style" id="align_center">What you don't make consciously in your life, manifests itself as a stimulus.</p>
                <p>I'll explain the soft skills using my philosophy: Natural selection & world is a reflect of ourselves. I believe everything happens in life is neutral. No bad, no good, just neutral and perfect. Don't you think so? The world manifest as only one rule: cause and effect. No moral, no religion, just responsibility. But, how do we reach such responsibility? Learning. Everything you see around is because only one main reason: learn.  For example: It depends on you if you want to continue disturbing yourself with the daily traffic, or learn how to deal with it.</p>
                <p>This website reveals some topics worked for me until know. It doesn't mean I have the absolute right or the only truth. My life is not an example of how to rule a life.  I believe the world is full of ignorance or, in other words, the world is full of fake and dangerous beliefs. How do I know this? Because I was the most ignorant human in the world.</p>
                <p>For me, the success of a company depends mostly on your team people. According to your business, of course other variables will be important: Market, finance, reputation, etc. Nowadays there's a factor which almost no company care: human factor. Most of every company issues depend on people. Some research says that human factor depends from 80% to 85% of the company issues. Which means, the rest depends on the technical development, finance, and the other variables. In my personal perspective it sounds pretty accurate but I challenge you to measure it. How often (based in your experience) have you see a team success or fail because human factor? Please, send me your reply :).</p>
